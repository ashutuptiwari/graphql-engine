# Send a Product Review Request Email

## Introduction

Scheduled Triggers allows you to schedule business, or other logic to occur at specific times or intervals. In this
guide, we'll explore how to use Scheduled Triggers to send a review request email for a product seven days after the
order is delivered. We'll do this by executing this trigger every day at midnight to check whether it has been seven
days since an order has been completed, if it has, and the user has not already received a reminder and has not left a
review for their purchase, we'll send them an email asking them to do so.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following in place:

- The docs e-commerce sample app deployed to Hasura Cloud.
- A working SMTP server or email-sending service that you can integrate with to send emails.

:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint from your local machine

If you plan on using a webhook endpoint hosted on your own machine, ensure that you have a tunneling service such as
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) set up so that your Cloud Project can communicate with your local machine.

:::

## Our model

When sending transactional emails such as this, there are three fundamental components to consider:

- **Your data source**: In your database, which table contains the value that you want to use to determine whether or
  not to send the email?
- **Your querying logic**: In your webhook, how will you query your database to determine whether or not to send the
  email? How will you return information so that you have the correct data to include in the email?
- **Your email templating**: How will you generate and send the email containing the information you want to send?

Our sample app's database contains, among others, three tables: `orders`, `products`, and `users`. The `orders` table
contains the details of all orders placed by customers, including the product ID, customer ID, order status, and
delivery date. The `products` table contains the details of all products, including the product name and description.
The `users` table contains the details of all users, including the user's email address.

## Step 1: Create the Scheduled Event

Head to your the Hasura Console of your project and navigate to the "Events" tab. From there, click on the
`Cron Triggers` item in the sidebar. Then, click `Create`:

  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

## Step 2: Configure the Scheduled Event

First, provide a name for your trigger, e.g., `send_review_request_email`. Then, enter a webhook URL that will be called
when the event is triggered. This webhook will be responsible for sending the review request email and can be hosted
anywhere, and written in any language, you like.

The route on our webhook we'll use is `/review-request`. Below, we'll see what this looks like with a service like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), but the format will follow this template:

```text
https://<your-webhook-url>/review-request
```

:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint to your local machine

You'll need to use a tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose a webhook endpoint running on your
local machine to the internet and Hasura Cloud. This will give you a public URL that will forward requests to your local
machine and the server which we'll configure below.

You'll need to modify your webhook URL to use the public URL provided by ngrok.

After installing ngrok and
[authenticating](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/tunnel-authtokens/#:~:text=Once%20you've%20signed%20up,make%20installing%20the%20authtoken%20simple.),
you can do this by running:

```bash
ngrok http 4000
```

Then, copy the `Forwarding` value for use in our webhook 🎉

:::

Next, we'll configure the cron expression that will trigger the event. In this example, we want to send requests at
midnight. We can do that with the following cron expression:

```
0 0 * * *
```

Our trigger must also have a payload. This payload will be sent to the webhook endpoint when the event is triggered. We
don't have to include any data in the payload, but we can if we want to. In this example, we'll simply send a
`trigger_type` property categorizing the event as a `review_requests`. In the `Payload` section, enter the following:

```json
{
  "trigger_type": "review_requests"
}
```

Under `Advanced Settings`, we can configure the headers that will be sent with the request. We'll add an
`authentication` header to prevent abuse of the endpoint and ensure that only Hasura can trigger the event. Set the
`Key` as `secret-authorization-string` and the `Value` as `super_secret_string_123`.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/scheduled-triggers/scheduled-triggers_recipes_review-request_auth-header.png"
  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

Also, change the `Request Transform Options` to `POST` so that the payload is sent in the request body.

Finally, click the `Add Cron Trigger` button to create the Scheduled Event.

## Step 3: Create a webhook to handle the request

Whenever a cron job is triggered, Hasura will send a request to the webhook URL you provided. In this example, we're
simply going to send a `POST` request. Our webhook will parse the request, ensure the header is correct, and then query
the database to determine which customers should receive a review request email.

Below, we've written an example of webhook in JavaScript. As we established earlier, this runs on port `4000`. If you're
attempting to run this locally, follow the instructions below. If you're running this in a hosted environment, use this
code as a guide to write your own webhook.

## Step 4: Test the setup

With your server running, Hasura should start hitting our endpoint. As we set our cron expression to `0 0 * * *`, the
webhook will be triggered at midnight every day. We don't want to wait that long to test it. For now, update the
expression to `* * * * *` to trigger the webhook every minute. Then, check out your invocation logs in the Hasura
Console to verify that the webhook was triggered successfully and your terminal to see the outputted information and
link to a handy email 🎉

Feel free to customize the webhook implementation based on your specific requirements and chosen email sending service.
Remember to handle error scenarios, implement necessary validations, and add appropriate security measures to your
webhook endpoint.
